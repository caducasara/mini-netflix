    synopsi: "The Simpsons live in the city of Springfield, an American city like any other. Homer works as a safety inspector at a nuclear power plant, Marge tries to keep the peace in her family, Bart is a mischievous 10-year-old boy, 8-year-old Lisa is the smart one in the family who loves to play the saxophone and is a vegetarian and little Maggie conquers everyone while she doesn't let go of her pacifier. And the series has a rich, and often strange, universe of characters that also inhabit Springfield. With clever scripts, subversive humor and playfully witty, the series makes fun of itself and everyone else who gets in its way.",
